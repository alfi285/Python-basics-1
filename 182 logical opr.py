# In python logical operators (and,or and not) are used to combine
# or modify conditions to control the flow of a program

#  and operator : Return True if both conditions are true

#  or operator : Return True if one condition is true

# not operator : Reverses the result of the condition:
# if a condition is True, not makes it false and vice versa
